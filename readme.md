# Simple RecyclerView in Java

https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/cardview

Apps often need to display data in similarly styled containers. These containers are often used 
in lists to hold each item's information. The system provides the CardView API as an easy way for 
you to show information inside cards that have a consistent look across the platform. These cards 
have a default elevation above their containing view group, so the system draws shadows below them. 
Cards provide an easy way to contain a group of views while providing a consistent style for the container.
